     <p>
         Bill Withers spent much of the 70s and early 80s creating some of the most timeless, heartfelt music in the American canon. <br> 
         During live performances, his entire band sat down as if they were in the living room of the audience, creating an intimacy <br>
         that was rare for such a high profile performer. Songs like <i>Lean On me</i>, <i>Grandma's Hands</i>, <i>Use me</i> and 
         <i>Lovely Day</i> will <br> forever live in the hearts.
         and minds of music lovers around the world.
